His research interests have primarily involved the variables underlying
how the skin processes two-dimensional patterns presented with vibrotactile
matrix systems. The majority of his work has employed arrays of mechanical
contactors of his own design fitted to different body sites. He is internationally known in the area of tactile transducers, co-authoring a book chapter on vibrotactile transducers, and has consulted in the successful development of new tactor systems with Sensor Electronics (Medford, New Jersey) through NIH SBIR grants (the MTAC, an ultradense vibrotactile array, and the Roto-Oscillating Crown tactor, a powerful tactor with a unique set of stimulation modes). He has authored 6 book chapters and encyclopedia articles on
tactile sensitivity as well as over 2 dozen journal articles and presentations
at professional meetings. He has been a consultant with government institutions,
including the National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of
Science, educational institutions, the military, and commercial laboratories.
