      <OL><LI>Enter the Main Gate and take

      <LI>Follow Duncan for approximately one mile.
      <LI>As Duncan curves to the left, another split in the road occurs.
      Continue straight at the split for about one block to the front of NAMRL,
      Building 1953 (This building contains our administrative services as well
      as a number of other laboratories.)
      <LI>To Building 1811, follow the left fork (Murray Road) and continue until you see the chapel (about 2 miles).
      <LI>Take the right fork onto Moffett Road
      <LI>Turn left onto Fisher Avenue.</OL>

    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="4">We are located on Fisher Avenue at the
      point where Saufley Street intersects it. The building is at the bottom
      right of the map, below, in a red circle pointed at with the arrow.
      Building 1811 has a distinctive roofline, with a round conical peak that
      tops off one of our acceleration devices. The entrance to the laboratory
      is on the side of the building, under the overhang, just off of the
      parking lot between the Bowling Alley and the Spatial Orientations lab.
      There is a large oval running track right behind us, and the BOQ is just
      beyond that, due North of us. The Chapel is East of us on the other side
      of the Parade Field.</font></td>
