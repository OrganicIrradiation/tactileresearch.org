      <p align="center"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our research projects 
      over the years we have used several types of tactors&#8230;such as the electromechanical vibrators (close up, shown on the left), manufactured by Engineering Acoustics, Inc. (<a href="http://www.eaiinfo.com/">www.eaiinfo.com</a>) 
      and small pager-motor tactors (center), commercially available from sources such as Marlin P Jones (<a href="http://www.mpja.com/">www.mpja.com</a>) or Jameco (<a href="http://www.jameco.com/">www.jameco.com</a>). 
      Steadfast Technologies also sells enclosed, wired versions of two types of 
      pager motors, including the &quot;pancake&quot; type in the middle array, as their 
      R1 and R2 Rototactors.&nbsp; We have also used pneumatic actuators (right), manufactured by Steadfast Industries.  Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages.  The electromechanical tactors have a relatively broad frequency range, a large intensitive range (allowing them to be used on virtually any body site that we have tested), but are somewhat expensive at this time (c. $200 $US as of 
      7/1/03).  The unmodified pager motor tactors are quite strong and very inexpensive (c. $3.00 $US), but their frequency (rate of rotation) and intensity are inherently linked and very limited.  The pneumatic tactors 
      from Steadfast are also quite inexpensive (c. $5.00 US$) but require a pulsed air source for their driving stimulus.  There are also limitations on tubing length/ diameter, but they are extraordinarily light, and strong enough for abdominal use.  
      As of summer 2004 we have not been able to make contact with Steadfast to 
      confirm current availability.&nbsp; We are working towards a page that will provide comparisons among these, 
      manufacturer links, and close up pictures of the tactors.</b>
