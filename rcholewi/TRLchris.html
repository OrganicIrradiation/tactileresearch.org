He was subsequently offered, and accepted, a full-time position in the Tactile Research Laboratory at NAMRL, a position he held from June of 2000 until July of 2001. Mr. Brill helped establish the Tactile Research Laboratory by developing its infrastructure and running the laboratory’s first formal experiments.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Brill left the Tactile Research Laboratory to pursue a Ph.D. 
in Applied Experimental and Human Factors Psychology at the University of 
Central Florida in Orlando, FL. His current research concerns developing a 
methodology and protocol for assessing spare cognitive-attentional capacity 
across sensory modalities (vision, audition, and touch). Additionally, he works 
for the UCF Institute for Simulation and Training, advising an engineering team with regards to the human perceptual requirements for tactile display design and integration of tactile displays with simulation technologies. 
His current Advisor at UCF, Prof. Richard Gilson, shares a branch of his 
professional family tree with Roger Cholewiak - they both received early 
training in the Princeton Cutaneous Communication Laboratory, under Profs. Frank 
Geldard and Carl Sherrick.</b><P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12px">
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brill earned his Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Northern Kentucky University and his Master’s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from the University of West Florida.</b></FONT></td>
