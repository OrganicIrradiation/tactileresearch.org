	Kristy Beede, a Laboratory Assistant, worked in the Tactile Research Lab at 
	the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory from December, 2001 through 
	August of 2004. She received her Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Rider 
	University in Lawrenceville New Jersey in 1999. During her service with the 
	Tactile Research Lab, she tested more subjects in more studies at NAMRL than 
	all of the other laboratories, combined.&nbsp; She continued testing 
	subjects in several studies initiated by Chris Brill, as well as starting 
	several new studies on vibrotactile localization on the abdomen.&nbsp; When 
	Anja Schwab arrived at the laboratory, Kristy took primary responsibility 
	for testing subjects in Ms. Schwab's experiments on the perception of 
	vibrotactile apparent movement generated on the abdomen with several modes 
	of stimulation using a number of tactile arrays.&nbsp; </FONT></b></p>

	was also taking courses in the evenings towards her Master's Degree in&nbsp; 
	Industrial/Organizational Psychology at the University of West Florida in 
	Pensacola.&nbsp; The thesis for that degree was completed in the Fall of 
	2004, shortly after her return to her home in the Philadelphia area where 
	she is working in research data analyses and interpretation.</FONT></b></td>
