	Cholewiak arrived at Princeton University from the University of Virginia as 
	a Research Associate in 1974 and became the Director of the laboratory in 
	1991 on the occasion of the retirement of Dr. Carl Sherrick. His research 
	interests have primarily involved the variables underlying how the skin 
	processes vibratory patterns presented with vibrotactile matrix systems in 
	basic and applied situations. The majority of his work has employed arrays 
	of mechanical contactors of his own design fitted to different body sites. 
	He is internationally known in the area of tactile transducers, co-authoring 
	a book chapter on vibrotactile transducers, and has consulted in the 
	successful development of new tactor systems.&nbsp; These have included the 
	Sensor Electronics (Medford NJ) MTAC, an ultra dense vibrotactile array, and 
	the Roto-Oscillating Crown tactor, a powerful tactor with a unique set of 
	stimulation modes, through NIH SBIR grants as well as the Tactile Situation 
	Awareness System at the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Labs (NAMRL - 
	Pensacola FL). In addition, he has also had consulting relationships with 
	Barron Associates (Charlottesville VA), Engineering Acoustics, Inc. (Winter 
	Park FL), Angel Medical Systems (Tinton Falls NJ), and the Institute of 
	Human-Machine Interactions (Pensacola FL). He has authored six book chapters 
	and encyclopedia articles on tactile sensitivity as well as over four dozen 
	journal articles and presentations at national and international 
	professional meetings. He has been a consultant with government 
	institutions, including the National Institutes of Health and the National 
	Academy of Science, educational institutions, the military, and commercial 
	research laboratories, and is a peer reviewer for numerous professional 
	journals, such as Brain Research and Perception &amp; Psychophysics. For additional professional 
	activities, see the links to <a href="../pucclabs/index.html">

	Cutaneous Communication Laboratory was supported completely by his grants 
	from the PHS/NIH Institutes of Deafness and other Communication Disorders, 
	NASA, and the Office of Naval Research (ONR).&nbsp; His grant support 
	averaged c. $400k/ year at Princeton to maintain the work of the Cutaneous 
	laboratory.&nbsp; While working at NAMRL, his work and his laboratory was 
	supported by CAPT Angus Rupert, MC, USN, and research grants from the ONR 
	and the Naval Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) in amounts averaging c. 
	$200k/ year.&nbsp; He retired from Princeton University in October, 2004, 
	closing the Cutaneous Communication Laboratory after almost 31 years of work 
	there. After 10 years of work with NAMRL, he closed his Tactile Research 
	Laboratory there in October, 2005.</FONT></b></div>
