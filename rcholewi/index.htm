	University of Virginia as a Research Associate in 1974 and became the Director of the laboratory 
	in 1991 on the occasion of the retirement of Dr. Carl Sherrick. His research interests have primarily involved the variables underlying how the skin processes 
	vibratory patterns presented with vibrotactile matrix systems 
	in basic and applied situations. The majority of his work has employed arrays of mechanical contactors of his own design fitted to different body sites. He is internationally known in the area of tactile transducers, co-authoring a book chapter on vibrotactile transducers, and has consulted in the successful development of new tactor systems.&nbsp; 
	These have included the Sensor Electronics (Medford NJ) MTAC, an ultra dense vibrotactile array, and the Roto-Oscillating 
	Crown tactor, a powerful tactor with a unique set of stimulation modes, 
	through NIH SBIR grants as well as the Tactile Situation Awareness System at 
	the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Labs (NAMRL - Pensacola FL). In 
	addition, he has also had consulting relationships with Barron Associates 
	(Charlottesville VA), Engineering Acoustics, Inc. (Winter Park FL), Angel 
	Medical Systems (Tinton Falls NJ), and the Institute of Human-Machine 
	Interactions (Pensacola FL). He has authored six book chapters and encyclopedia articles on tactile sensitivity as well as over 
	four dozen journal articles and presentations at national and international professional meetings. He has been a consultant with government institutions, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Science, educational institutions, the military, and commercial 
	research laboratories, and is a peer reviewer for numerous professional 
	journals, such as Perception &amp; Psychophysics and Brain Research.  For additional professional activities, see the links to </FONT>

	Cutaneous Communication Laboratory was supported completely by his grants 
	from the PHS/NIH Institutes of Deafness and other Communication Disorders, 
	NASA, and the Office of Naval Research (ONR).&nbsp; His grant support 
	averaged c. $400k/ year at Princeton to maintain the work of the Cutaneous 
	laboratory.&nbsp; While working at NAMRL, his work and his laboratory was 
	supported by CAPT Angus Rupert, MC, USN, and research grants from the ONR 
	and the Naval Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) in amounts averaging c. 
	$200k/ year.&nbsp; He retired from Princeton University in October, 2004, 
	closing the Cutaneous Communication Laboratory after almost 31 years of work 
	there. After 10 years of service, he closed his Tactile Research 
	Laboratory at NAMRL in October, 2005.</FONT></b></div>
